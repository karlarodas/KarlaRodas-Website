        I am a film major, so when I joined the TFDP department I was always interested in film. The first area of TFDP that caught my attention was acting.This leads me to consider that the primary skill for acting would be having your own way of acting and to be the character you are playing. Everyone should have their own type of style when acting and be the best character you can. Being able to fully immerse yourself in a character to act as best as you can. I got interested in acting and I shocked myself when I started to enjoy acting and how people would talk about it. I do not consider myself to be good on camera since I am a shy person. So when other people came in and talked about acting they made it seem like an amazing experience. What I would like to learn about acting is how people get ready to be the person they are trying to portray. It really is a unique gift to be able to immerse yourself into a character that you started off knowing nothing  about. I would also like to be a director because I was fascinated by how things work behind the scenes. I consider being a person who observes and listens to others to be a primary skill for a director. Being able to acknowledge what other option one has I would think makes a good director. I am interested in this position because a director's job is an important part of making something come to film. A director makes the piece come together in a way they envision it. I think having a piece the way you want it to be is what being a director does. So knowing the responsibilities that come with being a director, I want to learn about what makes each director different from one another? Seeing how different directors do their jobs and seeing how they control a set in a way. I think the transferable life-skill from being a director would be teamwork and communication skills. When youâ€™re a director you are working with people all the time so teamwork is a part of being one. Also having good communication skills to show how you want something done. Another thing I love about being a film student is filmmaking. I consider knowing how to use a camera and editing to be a primary skill for filmmaking. You have to make sure the shots youâ€™re taking are good while still having good editing skill to make it better. I am interested in filmmaking because I always had a thing for cameras and knowing how they work. I would like to learn more about how lighting and editing works to really make the film as nice as it could be. I would say filmmaking allows you to have creative thinking as a transferable life-skill. I see filmmaking as something that you constantly try to think outside of the box, which is why it creates a creative mindset. Overall, these are some things I love about being a film major that interest me the most.
